# Vector-Robot-Monte-Carlo-Localization-and-SLAM
Final project of graduate course "Advanced Robotics" at university of Tehran. n/
This repository contians implementations of Monte Carlo Localization(MCL) and Augmented Monte Carlo Localization(AMCL) with some modifications and also there is a simple version SLAM.
These are written in order to work on VECTOR-ROBOT on gazbo simulation and real world.
