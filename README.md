# Vector-Robot-Monte-Carlo-Localization-and-SLAM
Final project of graduate course "Advanced Robotics" at university of Tehran.  

This repository contians implementations of Monte Carlo Localization(MCL) and Augmented Monte Carlo Localization(AMCL) with some modifications and also there is a simple version SLAM.  

Codes are written in order to work on VECTOR-ROBOT on gazebo simulation and real world.  

The picture below is the graph that shows the percentage of particles within 5 cm range of the actual robot pose.  
After localizing the robot, a kiddnapping precegure happens and the algorithym is able to localize the robot again.
